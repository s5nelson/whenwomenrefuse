# Protective Orders

## What is a Protective Order or a Restraining Order?
A Protective Order or Restraining Order is a legal order issued by either a Magistrate or a Judge to protect the health and safety of an abused person and / or their family. 

**Please Note: A Protective Order or Restraining Order is a piece of paper, and while consequences of violating one can be severe, this is not a guarantee of safety**


## How do I get one?
Protective Orders or Restraining Orders can vary from state to state, but the process to procure one remains similar. 

The first step is to obtain either an Emergency Protective Order / Emergency Restraining Order. Usually, this is facilitated through Police or a Social Worker, who can help walk you through the steps. In this example, the Magistrate would determine, with a statement from you as well as any / all evidence as to the incident(s) or reasons why you need protection, whether or not the Emergency Order is granted. Once the Emergency Order has been granted, this lasts for 3 days - or until the hearing with a Judge for a Preliminary Protective Order (PPO) / Temporary Restraining Order (TRO). 

**Please Note: Even if you have been granted the Emergency Restraining Order, the Order does NOT go into effect until after the individual has been served by the Sheriff.**

In most states, a Preliminary Protective Order (PPO), or Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) is granted through a Judge based on just one testimony - yours, also known as ex parte. These orders are temporary, and last around 2 weeks (14-15 days) before a final court hearing determines whether the Protective Order or Restraining Order is granted. 

The Final Protective Order / Final Restraining Order has a full hearing in front of a Judge with the Defendant (the person you want the Restraining Order against), their Attorney, you, and your Attorney - as well as any witnesses. If the Final Protective Order is granted, they can last anywhere from 2 - 15 years, or for the life of the person. This portion varies by state, circumstances, and which court the Order is being entered into.
