# Legal Resources

In the United States, most Legal Aid Services are based upon a sliding scale of income for an individual or family. The full chart for the Federal Poverty Level is here: https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/federal-poverty-level-fpl/

If you make at or near the Federal Poverty Level, you may be eligible to receive free or greatly reduced Legal Aid.

If you do not make at or near the Federal Poverty Level, additional resources are available to you. 

The resources below cover a wide variety of topics including the following:

- Domestic Violence
- Divorce 
- Stalking
- Housing Law
- Wills and Trusts
- Family Law 
- Disability
